This is a python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that allows you to change the source GDB for multiple
layers in your map document. It works using the currently focused map document, if you are in a
layer document then it will use the active map frame in that layer document. This could be
relatively slow if you have a lot of layers in your map document.
